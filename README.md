# REP COUNTER

Quickly track the number of reps done in a set when working out, or the number of minutes that it took to walk/run a lap when repeating the same circuit (walking the block repeatedly for a 5k, for example)

- Increment the number of reps done in a set or minutes that it took to walk/run a lap
- Save the reps/lap time and enter a new one
