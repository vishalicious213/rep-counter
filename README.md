# REP COUNTER

This was a Scrimba project from Module 3 (Making Websites Interactive) of the [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) that I added onto with customizations. The original designed tracked the number of people who enter a train station each time a train stopped there. My redesign uses the same logic to quickly track the number of reps done in a set when working out, or the number of minutes that it took to walk/run a lap when repeating the same circuit (walking the block repeatedly for a 5k, for example). I also added the ability to reset the saved reps/laps so a new activity can be tracked.

- Increment the number of reps done in a set or minutes that it took to walk/run a lap
- Save the reps/lap time and enter a new one
- Reset the saved reps/laps
